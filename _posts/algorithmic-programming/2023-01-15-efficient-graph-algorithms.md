# Efficient Graph Algorithms for Competitive Programming

Graph algorithms are essential for solving a wide range of competitive programming problems. In this post, I'll discuss some of the most useful graph algorithms and their implementations.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is perfect for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs:
